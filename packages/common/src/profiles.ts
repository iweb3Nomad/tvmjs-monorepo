/**
 * The TRON execution profile. Parameter groups are listed explicitly instead of
 * inheriting an Ethereum network's hardfork schedule or consensus transitions.
 *
 * EIP numbers identify shared implementations, not Ethereum network upgrades.
 * Energy accounting follows TRON, without Ethereum access warming or refunds.
 * EIP-2930 is retained for transaction encoding, not access-list pricing.
 * Blob transactions, beacon roots, withdrawals and Ethereum consensus are absent.
 * Governance proposals remain independent of explicitly selected capabilities.
